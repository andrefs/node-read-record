# read-record

Async generator functions which return records read from a stream,
string or text file using a custom record separator.

In Perl or Awk, by default, files are read line by line, because `\n`
is used as the record or input field separator. If you want to change
this (to read records separated, for example, by ';' you can chage
`$/` (in Perl) or `RS` (in Awk) to ';'.

Node.js `readline` module
[documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_symbol_asynciterator)
explains how to use a `for await...of` loop to read lines from a file.
But what if it is not lines you want to read?

## Install

```shell
npm i -S read-record
```

```js
import AVLTree from 'avl-promise';
const rr = require('read-record');
```

[Try it in your browser](https://npm.runkit.com/read-record)


## API

* `rr.records(stream, recsep)`
  * `stream` is a [Readable
  Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams)
  * `recsep` is either a String or Regular Expression (anything that can
be passed on to `String.split()` method)

* `rr.recordsFromFile(path, recsep)`
  * `path` is a String containing a valid path to a text file.

* `rr.recordsFromString(str, recsep)`
  * `str` is a String.

## Example

```js
const rr = require('read-record');

const records = rr.recordsFromString('This is a string', ' ');

for await (const rec of records){
  console.log(rec);
}

// This
// is
// a
// string
```

## To do

* add option to discard empty records
* add option to define size of `fs.createReadStream` `highWaterMark`
* add option to define size of `fs.createReadStream` `encoding`
  param
* evalutate (and increase) efficiency
* use event 'line' instead of `for await...of` loop
* use `indexOf` instead of regular expressions?
